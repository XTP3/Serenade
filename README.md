# Serenade
A self-hosted Discord music bot for YouTube made using Node.js.  
After repeatedly dealing with unstable, broken, generally dysfunctional, and paywalled Discord bots just to be able to play YouTube audio in Discord, I decided to just make my own by using ffmpeg and youtube-dl. Ideally, this choice of technology should make it both easier to maintain as well as less likely to frequently break.

## Usage
Playing/Enqueueing: ```!play <youtubeURL>```  
Skipping Queue: ```!skip```  
Disconnecting/Stopping: ```!stop```

## Installation
### Installer
1. After installing Node.js, download the installer: [Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XTP3/Serenade/main/InstallSerenade.js)
2. Place it within your primary installation directory, and run ```node InstallSerenade.js```.
3. Run: ```node index.js```

### Manual
1. Clone the repo.
2. Enter the directory with the project files.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: ```npm install```
4. Enter the ```Config.json``` file and modify as necessary.
5. Run: ```node index.js```

## Config
To use the bot, simply add your Discord bot token, located in the ```Config.json``` file under the key ```TOKEN```.
Additionally, you can customize your command prefix character by modifying the value associated with the key ```PREFIX``` (set to '!' by default).

## Requirements
- Node.js v16.9.0 (v18.x+ recommended)
